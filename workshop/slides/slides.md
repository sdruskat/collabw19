# Documentation is key for software sustainability


## Q: What and how should we actually document?

1. **What** must be documented? [Are there minimal and maximal sets of documentation types to cover?]
2. **How** should different documentation types be written or generated? [Does the type of documentation to be created dictate the form?]

*Underlying question:* How much - if any - "trad" software engineering documentation practices does sustainable research software need?

*My perspective:* New research software project with a focus on sustainability: [hexatomic.github.io](https://hexatomic.github.io).
