# Documentation as key to software sustainability


## Q: What and how should we actually document?

1. **What** must be documented? [Are there minimal and maximal sets of documentation types to cover?]
2. **How** should different documentation types be written or generated? [Does the type of documentation to be created dictate the form?]
3. Requirements for **tooling**? [Is it available?]

*Underlying question:* How much - if any - "trad" software engineering documentation practices does sustainable research software need?

Perspective: new research software project with a focus on sustainability. [Hexatomic]
![hexatomic.github.io](https://hexatomic.github.io)

## Documentation types?

[IMG: UML/requirements] [IMG: Agile Manifesto]


## [New slide?]

Use case / explain Hexatomic / show what we've done to determine suitable tooling
Tooling is sorted, now we need to decide what and how to document


## Discussion starters

- "Traditional" software engineering vs. agile methods?
	- README.md + code comments *or* Requirements docs + UML?
- Can good practice suggestions be defined? (How?) [Granularity? Project-specificity too high?]
- Can we define thresholds for different documentation practices along types of research software?
	- Script: README.md + inline documentation
	- Package: ?
	- "Platform"/"framework": Full-blown old school SE documentation
- How do other factors impact decisions? 
	- Can they be defined, and their influence described?
- Who should define these best practices
	- Hack sessions today & tomorrow?
- What am I missing?

Let's start the discussion // become part of it
